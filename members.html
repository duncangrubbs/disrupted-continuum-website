          <h3>Leila Siegel - Guitar, Vocals</h3>
          
          The lead singer and primary songwriter of Disrupted Continuum, Leila is a veritable tornado of creative energy. She released a demo of four original songs, titled Toxic Storm, last year before she started the band. When she's not writing songs or playing her beloved Les Paul, Leila enjoys drawing and painting the beautifully bizarre figments of her imagination.

          Interesting fact: she can stand on her head for up to three minutes.

          <h3>Cole Bailey - Drums</h3>
          
          Cole has been in the music scene for years.  Although he's only 16, he's played with a wide variety
          of renowned jazz, folk, and blues musicians before co-founding Disrupted Continuum.  He is able to 
          blend the complexity of jazz rhythms with the driving force of rock and metal, a feat few drummers 
          accomplish.  Cole's infectious drumming will make your head implode and your teeth dance out of your 
          face, in the most awesome way possible.

          Interesting fact: he is infamous for smashing drum kits.  Drums beware!

          <h3>Gianni Pompili - Guitar</h3>

          Who's that kid with the upside-down strat? It's Gianni P, of course! A powerhouse guitarist with the soul of a bluesman, Gianni can bring any joint crumbling to the ground with one of his blistering guitar solos. Sometimes he also plays bass, and occasionally enjoys screaming into a microphone.  A man of many talents, Gianni is also an accomplished rower. 

          Interesting fact: He shook Paul McCartney's hand when he was five, but doesn't remember.
