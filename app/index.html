          <h3>The Saga of Disrupted Continuum</h3>

          <p>
            Once apon a time, in the small town of Fairfax California, there lived a girl named Leila  who wanted to be in a rock band. With the guidance of her guitar teacher Sonny Walker, a bell-bottom-jeans-wearing, van-driving rock guru, she teamed up with two classmates: Cole Bailey the drumologist and Gianni Pompili the guitarman. The three Drake High School students bonded over their shared appreciation of classic rock (the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix) as well as newer, more sinister metal (the Melvins, Tool) and hardcore punk (Fugazi, Bad Brains). Thus, an embryonic form of Disrupted Continuum began practicing in the attic of a local gift shop. At first they mostly jammed on Hendrix songs, and then eventually Leila's original songs. Leila recruited Noa Z, a longtime friend, to play bass. Noa agreed, although she was already pursuing a career as an acoustic singer-songwriter, and only knew heavy metal as the element group containing mercury and lead. In the beginning, the screeching cacophony of sound they created, topped with Leila's aggressive singing style, would have sent the dogs of doom running with their tails between their legs. But after a couple months of practice, and with the addition of Noa's rock-steady bass lines, they actually got pretty good. So good, in fact, that they decided to try their luck at the DNA Lounge battle of the bands in San Francisco.

            At this point, the four young musicians realized that if they were going to make a name for themselves, they must first choose a name. Cole originally wanted to call the band "the discipline", but Leila thought that sounded too abusive. Leila wanted to name the band "the angry spleen", but Noa and Cole thought that was too stupid. Noa suggested simply calling the band "blue", but Leila and Cole thought that was too boring.  Gianni didn't have any ideas for a name, but insisted that he was "cool with anything". Eventually they settled on the name Disrupted Continuum, although to this day nobody except Cole knows what that means.

            After unexpectedly winning the first round of battle of the bands, Disrupted Continuum began playing gigs in small clubs all around the Bay Area. They became known for their unique sound, somewhere in between punk and metal with occasional exotic twists, but always definitively rock. They also became known for their dynamic, high-energy stage performance, with Leila and Gianni trading off lead and rhythm guitar over Cole's wildly complex drumming. They took third place in the final battle of the bands, but were undeniably the most original (and youngest) band of the night. To this day they continue to grow and improve, constantly expanding their horizons and bringing new elements into their music.  Disrupted Continuum is here to bring rock-n-roll to a new generation, and spread the music revolution!
